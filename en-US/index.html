    <h2>What’s in it for me?</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Tectonic <b>automatically downloads support files</b> so you don’t
        have to install a full LaTeX system in order to start using it. If you
        start using a new LaTeX package, Tectonic just pulls down the files it
        needs and continues processing. The underyling “bundle” technology
        allows for <b>completely reproducible document compiles</b>.</li>
      <li>The <tt>tectonic</tt> command-line program is <b>quiet and never
          stops to ask for input</b>.</li>
      <li>Thanks to the power of XeTeX, Tectonic can use <b>modern OpenType
          fonts</b> and is <b>fully Unicode-enabled</b>.</li>
      <li>The Tectonic engine has been extracted into a <b>completely
          self-contained library</b> so that it can be embedded in other
          applications.</li>
      <li>Tectonic has been forked from the old-fashioned WEB2C implementation
        of TeX and is <b>developed in the open</b>
        on <a href="https://github.com/tectonic-typesetting/tectonic/">GitHub</a>
        using modern tools like <a href="https://www.rust-lang.org/">the Rust
        language</a>.</li>
    </ul>
